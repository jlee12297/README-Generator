# README-Generator
This project has been created to help potential users create a basic README.md file, which takes into account user input to detail sections of the file.
The README Generator provides a solid professional README template, where users can simply interact w/ the console using node js and inquirer to populate the page with information chosen by them.
This project was built entirely using javascript and using node js plus inquirer. Following all the given starter code was a bit of a challenge, but I was able to incorporate all of it into the code.
Basic Steps:
User should use the terminal to navigate into the README-GENERATOR Develop folder, then they may use the command node index.
The user should then be able to answer all the questions to populate the README file, and a file called test.md should be generated w/ the users new personalized generated README.
