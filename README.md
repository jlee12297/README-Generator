# README-Generator
This project has been created to help potential users create a basic README.md file, which takes into account user input to detail sections of the file.
The README Generator provides a solid professional README template, where users can simply interact w/ the console using node js and inquirer to populate the page with information chosen by them.
This project was built entirely using javascript and using node js plus inquirer. Following all the given starter code was a bit of a challenge, but I was able to incorporate all of it into the code.
